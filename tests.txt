./philosophers 200 1000 200 200 (bad death detector)

 printf used 

 no global death routine
 
 overlapping prints



 TODO :

 DISCARD the old death checks per philo
 ADD a death detector routine with a dedicated death or meal 
 protect all meal checks (times_must_eat && deaths)
 ADD a function that prints using write with a dedicated mutex for writting


Things to consider :

starting time for all philos
grabing forks logic
there is no negative time so all the time calc's and cmp's should be unsigned longs
threads should communicate with each other to find about a death


Pros :

memory efficient
id % 2 sync
